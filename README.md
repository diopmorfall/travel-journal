## My process

### Built with

- React
- CSS3 custom properties
- Mobile first development
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to build a little webapp that can render an array of data, by mapping through it to create an array of custom components that'll be rendered

### Continuous development

Rendering data from an array of objects by mapping through it and creating custom components is a great task in React, and it's important to learn it since we'll likely have to work with these kind of data.
